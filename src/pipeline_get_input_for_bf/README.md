## Purpose
This pipeline takes Omnigraph graph data and gives output of a file that specifies feature names and each feature's count for each sentence.
The final output of this pipeline is a .txt file ready to be used as the input document for get_features.py.

## Directories
The directory of this pipeline, pipeline_get_input_for_bf, in CCLS network is as follows:
/export/projects/enriched-topic-modeling/data/edgar/pipeline_get_input_for_bf

In “pipeline_get_input_for_bf”, there are 4 sub-directories: 

- data: contains the .graph data provided by Hooshmand (10K_2016-03-13.graph)
- “script": contains 2 .py python script and 1 bash script (prepare_graph_forexplorer.py, match_doc_sen.py, run.sh)
- “bin”: contains all the java classes needed for configuring and running Boyi’s GraphFeatureExplorer.java
- “output”: the directory that we wish to put the final output of feature counts (i.e. input file used in Lauren’s BF script). Before running the bash script run.sh, the “output” directory is empty. 

## How to Run
To run this small pipeline, we need to change directory to “pipeline_parse_graph_get_bf”:

Then, type the following command:

```sh
$ ./script/run.sh ./toy_data/toy_example.graph 2 ./output/bf_input
```
Note that the above command line takes 3 input arguments for the bash script run.sh:

- 10K_2016-03-13.graph: this is the filename of full 10K data provided by Hooshmand
- integer “2": this integer specifies maximum number of nodes in feature. For any nonnegative integer n, maximum number of nodes in feature = n + 1. So in this argument, we specify that n = 2 i.e. maximum number of nodes in feature is 3.
- bf_input: this is the filename of the final output document that contains doc_ID, sentence_ID, feature names, and feature’s count. The file bf_input is ready to be passed to Lauren’s get_features.py (BF code).

The bash script run.sh will generate intermediary files and store them temporarily in a “temp” folder in the system. Once the bash script finishes up running, it will remove all temporary intermediary files, and only gives the final output “bf_input” in the “output” directory.
